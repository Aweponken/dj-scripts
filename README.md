# DJ Scripts

The repo holds some scripts that I find useful when gardening my music library.

## A word of caution

**NOTE:** I take no responsbility at all for these scripts. I use them and I find them helpful at times. Maybe you will, maybe you won't. 

## Help?

Feel free to open an issue if you need any help or have a suggestion. PRs are also welcome, but please reach out first.
